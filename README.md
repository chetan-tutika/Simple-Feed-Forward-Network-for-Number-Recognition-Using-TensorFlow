# Simple-Feed-Forward-Network-for-Number-Recognition-Using-TensorFlow
This project was implemented to learn the basics of tensorflow and to model a simple feed forward neural system to detect numerical digits and to calculate the accuracy of the system<br />
Msnist dataset provided by Tensor flow was used
### Results

While the accuracy of 97% is low compared to the standards, this model was just to get to know the basics of tensorflow.
